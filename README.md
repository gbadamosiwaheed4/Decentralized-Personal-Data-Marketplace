# Decentralized Personal Data Marketplace

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how personal data is owned, shared, and monetized by returning control to individuals while creating a transparent ecosystem for ethical data commerce.

## Overview

This decentralized personal data marketplace empowers individuals to take ownership of their personal data, selectively grant access permissions, receive fair compensation for its use, and maintain visibility into how their information is being utilized. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform creates a trustless environment that ensures transparency, security, and fair value exchange in the data economy.
